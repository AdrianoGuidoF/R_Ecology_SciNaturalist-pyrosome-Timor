## Title: Occurence of the pyrosome, _Pyrosoma atlanticum_, in Timor-Leste

Blooms of _Pyrosoma atlanticum_ were observed in late 2019 in Timor-Leste at two sites. Data on the occurence of pyrosomes globally was searched in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility using the _P. atlanticum_ taxonkey. The data search can be found [here](

# Directions
The code provided the in scripts creates Figure 2 and Figure S1. Download or clone the repository locally and open the `.Rproj` file. Create a `data` and `figures` directory in the project where the data and figures will be written too.

Run the two `.R` scripts to reproduce the two figures. Note: The scripts use the native R pipe which will require R v4.0 or greater.
